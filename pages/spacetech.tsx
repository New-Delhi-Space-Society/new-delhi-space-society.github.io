        <h3> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet </h3>
        <p> Progress in technology means pushing the boundaries of what is possible, not only on earth, but also the final frontier — space. Just as biological systems undergo evolution when subjected to strenuous conditions which threaten their survival, computer systems and technology too evolve and become more sophisticated if subjected to extraordinary circumstances. And what is a more strenuous, more demanding environment than space? With this in mind, Exun Clan collaborates with the New Delhi Chapter of the prestigious National Space Society (USA) to give students the opportunity to explore the realms of space and its concurrence with technology. The event typically has multiple challenging rounds, building up to a final presentation round — with a twist! </p>
